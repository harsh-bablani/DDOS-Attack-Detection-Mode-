## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/harsh-bablani/DDOS-Attack-Detection-Mode-.git
cd DDOS-Attack-Detection-Mode-
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*If there is no `requirements.txt`, ensure you manually install packages like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc.*

## üß© Usage

### 1. Preprocessing Data

Preprocess the dataset and prepare it for modeling:
```
python preprocessing.py
```

### 2. Training the Model

Train the DDoS detection model:
```
python train.py
```

### 3. Evaluating the Model

Generate performance metrics and validation results:
```
python evaluation.py
```

### 4. Visualization

Visualize analysis results and plots:
```
python visualization.py
```

### 5. Additional Plots

Create custom data or model plots:
```
python plots.py
```
